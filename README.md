## About the Video Course
Welcome to this comprehensive course on network hacking! This course is focused on the practical side of penetration testing without neglecting the theory behind each attack. Before jumping into penetration testing, you will first learn how to set up a lab and install needed software to practice penetration testing on your own machine. All the attacks explained in this course are launched against real devices in the author's lab. The course is structured in a way that will take you through the basics of Linux, computer systems, networks and how devices communicate with each other, then you will learn how to exploit this method of communication to carry out a number of powerful attacks. This course will take you from total beginner to a more advanced level. All the attacks in this course are practical attacks that work against any wireless enabled device, so it does not matter if the device is a phone, tablet, laptop, or another device. These attacks also work against all operating systems (Windows, OSX, Linux IOS, Android, and so on.). Each attack is explained in a simple way first so that you understand how it actually works; first, you will learn the theory behind each attack and then you will learn how to carry out the attack using Kali Linux.
